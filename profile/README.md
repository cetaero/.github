## 🛠️ About Us

**AeroCET** is the official aerotechnical club of the College of Engineering Trivandrum (CET), dedicated to the design, analysis, and testing of custom-built aeromodels.  
Founded in 2018 by a small group of aeromodelling enthusiasts, the club has evolved into a dynamic team of over 60 members, actively pushing the boundaries of student aerospace innovation.

We regularly participate in national-level competitions and contribute to advancements in the field of aviation. At our core, we aim to cultivate hands-on aeromodelling skills and ignite a passion for aerospace engineering among the student community at CET.
